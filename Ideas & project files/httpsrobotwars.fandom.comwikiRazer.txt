Top 10 Badassest Robot Wars robots

What's up Messyng army, today we're going to be counting down our top 10

10. Chaos 2

Kicking off straight away with a classic design. We here at Messyng HQ aren't fans of flipping robots but there's something so enticing about Chaos 2's design. It's speed was definitely a factor in it's success, reaching a not-insignificant 20kmph .There was plenty of design faults in Chaos 1 that were rectified in it's second championship winning design, and it's why we consider the 2nd iteration of this bot worthy of our number 10 spot.

9. Growler

Seriously - where would you even start trying to attack this thing? This industrial puppy is kind of a defensive masterclass right down to the metal coverings over the tyres. It's attack options were a bit limited, mostly just biting and shoving, but short of somehow managing to flip this thing, I think you would be screwed by the power and speed that it manages to fit into that sizeable chasis. Maybe it's bark isn't as big as his bite!

8. Mr Psycho

We couldn't have one but not the other, now, could we?

-

7. Sergeant Bash

It's hard to miss with the house robots. With budgets and know how behind them it's easy to understand why, but Sergeant Bash is such a mess of creativity. It's got a claw, it's got a flame thrower, it's got 

-

6. Pussycat

Easy idea - Let's build a robot that makes the most common attack useless? Good. Now how do you make it attack as well? Enter a big saw. This kitty certainly has claws.

5. Dead Metal

4. Tornado

What can we say? We are suckers for the no-right-way-up design principle. But Tornado solves a big of a significant design flaw that Pussycat had. The saw being so exposed that it becomes easy to knock off. Tornado hides more of the blade inside it's body that it exposes, making it really difficult to disarm.

-

3. Hypno Disc.

Despite being an extremely successfully, consistent, and destructive bot it's strange to think that hypno-Disc was never successful in "spinning-to-win" a Robot Wars final. The design of Hypno-disc is extremely iconic, however our feature isn't actually the spinning disc. No, our favourite design component has to be the self righting arm, rendering any flipping opponents virtually powerless. Hypno-Disc never won a championship, but we absolutely think it was deserving.

-

2. Sir Killalot.

Probably the most identifiable robot on this list. Sir Killalot is Robot Wars. When you hear Robot Wars, this is probably the Robot you think of first. Weighing in at 520kg, this literal half ton killing machine had hydraulic claw for an arm that was able to decimate up to 5 times it's body weight.

-

Before we declare our number one robot, we've just got a few honourable mentions that we'd like to get through for weird or wacky robots that didn't quite make our top 10 list.

HONOURABLE MENTIONS:

Wheely Big Cheese's design is deceptive - it might look like a simple flipping robot but you quickly realise that it being functional both ways shirks the need for self-correction against flipping robots, and it's triangular shape makes it very difficult for claw and pincer based bots to take a bite of this chunk of cheese.

-

Refbot never partook in any competitive matches, but it's quick pace, hefty weight, and cow catcher design would have made it, at least, an interesting competitor if they had.

-

Diotoir wasn't the most practical design - they caught fire, they wer easy to get a grip on, they didn't have much self correction, or even many weapons - 

-

1. Razer

9 tonnes of pressure coming from it's claw Chock full of so much power that the only way it could meet the weight limitations was to drill the thing full of holes to shave off those precious few grams.
